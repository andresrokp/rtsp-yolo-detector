Investigate Error
`ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
LEARN
* ``libGL.so.1`` is a shared binary code file (like a ddl in windows) . `libGL.so.1` is put in system by the ``libgl1`` linux package. `libgl1` is an all-terrain massive graphics library called OpenGL . Ubuntu 22 requires `libgl1-mesa-dev` . Seems ``libgl1-mesa-dev`` is a 'dummy' library wrapper to translate real libgl1
    * chatGPT
* install ``libgl1-mesa-dev``
